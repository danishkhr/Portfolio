<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a student at Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia (UTHM), currently enrolled in the Computer Science course. I'm aiming to become one of the top web developer in this country. My experience in web development include creating a Movie Ranking Project and a Birthday Invite Project. I'm still a beginner and trying to learn this new knowledge slowly.</p>

<p>I'm willing and able to work in group projects efficiently. I also have a good command of leadership whenever there is a group assignment given my professor. I can speak both the Malay and English language. I also know a little bit of French. Knowing the English language allows me to communicate with various people. This will prove to be a valuable skill in communication.</p>

<p>My aim in the workplace is to achieve things that help me grow as a person and also grow my career. Give my projects and i would complete the project efficiently.</p>
